# sudoku-solver
A Sudoku 3x3 solver with multiple solving techniques

This sudoku solver is intended to demonstrate the backtracking algorithm as well as some other solving techniques in the future.

I also plan to add an interactive web app (user can add clues to the sudoku grid) detailing the process through which the different algorithms solve the puzzle.

In addition to this I will keep track of the number of cell visits to compare the algorithms.
