# sudoku-solver
A Sudoku 3x3 solver with multiple solving techniques

This sudoku solver is intended to demonstrate the backtracking algorithm as well as some other solving techniques in the future.

I also plan to add an interactive web app detailing the process through which the different algorithms solve the puzzle.
